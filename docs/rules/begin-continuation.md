# Begin/Continuation Rule

## `begin`/`beginRegex`
The `begin` and `beginRegex` properties indicate the beginning of a folding region. One of them is required.

## `continuation`/`continuationRegex`
Starting the first line of the folding region, each line must match the properties `continuation` or `continuationRegex`. One of the properties is required.  
The last line of the folding region may not match the properties `continuation` or `continuationRegex`.  

Itâ€™s allowing single-line comments to contain line-continuation character.
```
"cpp": {
	"begin": "//",
	"continuation": "\\"
}
```

## `foldEOF`
The `foldEOF` property is a boolean (set to `false` by default).  
If the value is `true`, when the end of file is reached, the folding range will be closed on the last line.

## `foldLastLine`
The `foldLastLine` property is a **boolean** (set to `true` by default).  
If the value is `true`, the folding range will include the last line.  
If the value is `false`, the folding range will exclude the last line. In such case, the last line will remain visible when the range is closed.

## `kind`
The `kind` property indicates if the folding range is a `comment` or a `region` (set to `region` by default).

## `bypassProtection`
The `bypassProtection` property is a **boolean**.  
If the value is `false`, by default, all **regex**es which are matching an empty string, are discarded. This is in order to protect against infinite loops.  
If you want to match an empty line, you will need to disable the protection by setting this property to `true`.

## `autoFold`
The `autoFold` property is a **boolean** (set to `false` by default).  
If the value is `true`, the folding range will be folded automatically.
